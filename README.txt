OpenMDAO wrapper for pyOpt, an open-source optimization package that provides a Python
interface for ~15 Optimizers, half of which are also open_source and included in
pyOpt. Note, pyOpt must be downloaded and installed separately. the pyOpt project is
actively maintained by its author Dr. Ruben Perez at:

http://www.pyopt.org

This wrapper was tested against pyOpt 1.1, but should also work for earlier versions.
