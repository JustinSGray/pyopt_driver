OpenMDAO wrapper for pyOpt, an open-source optimization package that provides a Python
interface for ~18 Optimizers, half of which are also open_source and included in
pyOpt. Note, pyOpt must be downloaded and installed separately. The pyOpt project is
actively maintained by its author Dr. Ruben Perez at:

http://www.pyopt.org

This wrapper was tested against pyOpt 1.1, but should also work for earlier versions.

Also, note that some of the optimizers in pyOpt must also be obtained separately. Those
optimizers that are not commercial, which is roughly half of them, are included in
the pyOpt package.
